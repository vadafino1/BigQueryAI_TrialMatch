# Clinical Trial Matching at Scale with BigQuery 2025

## Introduction

We built a production-ready clinical trial matching system using BigQuery 2025's cutting-edge AI and vector search capabilities to match patients from MIMIC-IV with clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov. Our solution demonstrates how modern data warehouse features can transform healthcare by reducing patient-trial matching time from 2-4 weeks to under 1 second.

## Problem Statement

Clinical trial recruitment is a $125 billion annual challenge. Traditional manual matching methods:
- Take 2-4 weeks per patient
- Miss 70% of eligible candidates
- Cost $2,500 per match
- Create bottlenecks in drug development

We aimed to solve this using BigQuery 2025's native vector search, AI functions, and scalable architecture to enable real-time, accurate patient-trial matching at unprecedented scale.

## Approach

### Data Pipeline Architecture

#### 1. Patient Data Processing (MIMIC-IV)
- **Scale**: Imported 145,914 MIMIC-IV patients with complete medical histories
- **Temporal Normalization**: Transformed timestamps from 2100-2200 range to 2023-2025 for accurate eligibility assessment
- **Profile Generation**: Created comprehensive profiles for 50,000 patients including:
  - Demographics (age, gender, ethnicity)
  - Clinical conditions (ICD-10 codes)
  - Laboratory results (40M+ data points)
  - Medications (16M+ records)
  - Radiology reports (2.3M+ reports)
- **Embedding Generation**: Created 10,000 patient embeddings (768-dimensional) using strategic selection based on clinical complexity

#### 2. Clinical Trials Integration (ClinicalTrials.gov)
- **Volume**: Loaded 66,966 active clinical trials
- **Strategic Embedding**: Generated 5,000 trial embeddings with therapeutic diversity:
  - Oncology: 1,500 trials (30%)
  - Cardiac: 750 trials (15%)
  - Diabetes: 750 trials (15%)
  - Other conditions: 2,000 trials (40%)
- **Eligibility Processing**: Extracted structured criteria using AI.GENERATE functions

#### 3. BigQuery 2025 Features Implementation

##### Vector Search with TreeAH Indexes
```sql
-- Native VECTOR_SEARCH implementation without LATERAL joins
CREATE VECTOR INDEX patient_treeah_idx
ON `clinical_trial_matching.patient_embeddings`(embedding)
OPTIONS(index_type='TREE_AH', distance_type='COSINE');

-- Optimized similarity search
SELECT trial_id, (1 - distance) AS similarity_score
FROM VECTOR_SEARCH(
  TABLE `clinical_trial_matching.trial_embeddings`,
  'embedding',
  (SELECT embedding FROM patient_embeddings WHERE patient_id = @patient_id),
  top_k => 10,
  options => '{"fraction_lists_to_search": 0.05}'
);
```

##### AI Functions for Eligibility Assessment
```sql
-- Using AI.GENERATE for clinical reasoning
SELECT AI.GENERATE(
  prompt => CONCAT('Assess eligibility for: ', patient_summary,
                   ' against trial: ', trial_criteria),
  connection_id => 'vertex_ai_connection',
  endpoint => 'gemini-2.5-flash',
  model_params => JSON '{"temperature": 0.0, "maxOutputTokens": 100}'
).result AS eligibility_assessment;
```

##### ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING for Semantic Understanding
```sql
-- Generate 768-dimensional embeddings
SELECT ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING(
  MODEL `text-embedding-004`,
  (SELECT clinical_summary AS content FROM patient_profiles),
  STRUCT(768 AS output_dimensionality, 'RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT' AS task_type)
) AS patient_embedding;
```

### Technical Innovation: Semantic Detective Approach

Our three-stage pipeline avoids the N×M explosion problem:

1. **Retrieval Stage**: TreeAH vector search identifies top-100 semantically similar trials
2. **Ranking Stage**: Hybrid scoring combines semantic similarity with clinical criteria
3. **Eligibility Stage**: AI.GENERATE performs detailed eligibility assessment

This approach reduces 10,000 × 5,000 = 50M potential comparisons to just 10,000 × 100 = 1M targeted evaluations.
