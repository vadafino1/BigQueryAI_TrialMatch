We have identified a clinical trial opportunity with exceptional compatibility to your medical profile.

MATCH DETAILS (From BigQuery Semantic Analysis):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Trial: {row['brief_title']}
• Semantic Match Score: {row['similarity_score']:.4f} (cosine similarity)
• Match Category: {row['match_quality']}
• Therapeutic Area: {row['therapeutic_area']}
• Phase: {row['phase']}
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

WHY THIS MATCH?
{row['match_explanation']}

This match was identified using BigQuery 2025's advanced semantic matching capabilities:
• ML.GENERATE_EMBEDDING created 768-dimensional vectors
• VECTOR_SEARCH identified semantic similarity
• Cosine distance measured compatibility

Your profile shows {row['similarity_score']*100:.1f}% alignment with this trial's requirements, placing it in the {row['match_quality']} category.

WHAT MAKES THIS A {row['match_quality'].replace('_', ' ')}?
""" + (
